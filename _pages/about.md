I obtained my B.E. of Software school at Fudan University in 2020.
Then, I will study for a Ph.D. at Fudan University, under supervision of [Dr. WeiLi Han](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/wlhan/).

My research interests include data analysis on the blockchain and the combination of blockchain and multi-party secure computing.
