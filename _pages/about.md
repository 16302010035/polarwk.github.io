I obtained my B.E. of Computer Science and Technology at China University of Petroleum (Beijing) in 2019.
Now, I am studying for a Ph.D. at Fudan University, under supervision of [Dr. WeiLi Han](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/wlhan/).

My research interests include distributed machine learning, secure multi-party computation and federated learning.
